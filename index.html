        “Should I keep trying?” he said. To himself. Because by now <em>my</em> attention was elsewhere. I mouthed along with his next sentence, having already heard it three times this morning. This would be the fourth.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Chances are that guy was her MC fling, and that when I fell through, she followed up with him.”
      </p>
      <p>
        He realised he'd lost me, probably when he noticed I’d typed into my phone ‘MC Fling’ under the heading ‘Possible Future Stage Names’.
      </p>
      <p>
        “So <em>that</em> I’ll have to deal with; if she’s still interested.”
      </p>
      <p>
        That got my attention. Not only was that a decision, a break from the morning’s cycle, but it was almost as if he was serious. I'd stopped walking midstep.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Would that really <em>be</em> such a bad thing?” I wondered.
      </p>
      <p>
        No. No, I don’t think it would. I think it might even be a <em>good</em> thing. Not because he seemed serious, but because persistence suggests commitment. And <strong>that</strong> suggests goodness. For this I say ‘yay!’.
      </p>
      <h2>
        hindsight
      </h2>
      <p>
        This friend of mine, yesterday, had had this “sort of date thing” that he had been “really kinda looking forward to”. He had gone on to inform me that somehow (although strangely not <em>that</em> out of character for him) he had misread their plan to “meet at 9” as “meet at 9 <strong>am</strong>”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Painfully for him (and his circadian rhythm) he’d woken up at 6 <strong>pm</strong> the evening prior fully rested. So when a night out with friends landed him home at 5am the day of the rendezvous, he figured he’d stay up and spend the time getting ready (rather than — say — attempt to sleep).
      </p>
      <p>
        He went on to explain that at some point, around 8:15am or so, it dawned on him how obscure it was for someone to finish work at 9am, and <em>then</em> want to meet up. Feeling somewhat the simpleton, he re-read the SMS (with his newly found brain) and he now had 12 hours till the new “9”.
      </p>
      <h2>
        co-tenant
      </h2>
      <p>
        Not long after the “off by 12 hours” discovery (~9:15 by now) his housemates both informed him they’d given their 28 days notice to leave. My friend then spent the next 4 hours tracking down rent agreements and googling the logistics of tenancy transfers … in the end conceding he was committed to leave with his housemates (as apparently single bond co-tenancy agreements imply).
      </p>
      <p>
        He spent the remaining daylight hours <em>not</em> freaking out, rather trying to work out how he could keep the place; digging into leases, bonds, bond loans, private loans, gumtree, types of leases, co-tenancies, subleasing, tenancy acts — a multitude of words that until now, had “just worked”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, and all too soon, he had to start getting ready (again) for his 9 o’clock. Checking his phone for the first time since the news, it struck him he’d missed lunch with a friend, and a job search appointment he <em>had</em> to attend. He blazed off apologetic SMSes, then put his phone on silent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Awake now for over 30 hours, it was around this time that things started to sink in. The sleep deprivation and madness of the last 24 hours urged my friend to pike – to call the night off. But he really wanted to meet his “sort of date” again. It was, after all, why he hadn't slept the night before, so he <strong>was</strong> going to turn up.
      </p>
      <h2>
        enthroned
      </h2>
      <p>
        In parallel with the evening, he arranged a last minute wingman of sorts in a mutual friend of ours. Our mutual friend informed him that he’d be out with a theatrical consort of his — yet at a public venue; so my friend was <em>obviously</em> welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon arrival, he soon realised that his friend had failed to mention that he was unofficially “crashing” a birthday. And not only that, his friend <em>seemed</em> to be trying to set him up with one of his co-workers …
      </p>
      <p>
        Somehow (amidst the $17 cocktails, suits and high backed chairs) he managed to avoid birthday party suicide; in spite of (or due to?) his eclectic conversations. Which ranged from desiring to own a throne in a custom designed shipping container; and his musings on social expectations influencing exhibited sexual preference: and how that in turn (presently) marginalises holders of ideals such as transgender, polyamory and pansexuality.
      </p>
      <p>
        There also happened a mature conversation about mental health; which he found quite refreshing.
      </p>
      <h2>
        silver lining
      </h2>
      <p>
        Yet whilst at Expensive Venue™, he couldn’t shake the feeling he’d rather be elsewhere. With the people he’d thought he would be by 9am. Now ½ a day hence, he was torn. Yes, he <em>started</em> uninvited, but now he was obliged to stay until his friend left.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bright side: he self insisted. The chairs were awesome. They had $8 pots. And the conversation was keeping him quite engaged.
      </p>
      <p>
        At 11:30 they left, and enroute he spent his last $2 on two coffees from 7 eleven, one for him and one for his friend. Whom (I theorise) he was hoping would shout him a beer at the destination.
      </p>
      <h2>
        be all
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sleep deprived, caffeinated, ‘28 days noticed’, and now penniless. At least he had his health, they usually say as consolation.
      </p>
      <p>
        They also say – sometimes – that you had to be there. And possibly, it's true. For he seemed sombre, but happy. Satisfied the remaining happenstance not be recounted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inherently subjective, or some such, perhaps. Although to be truthful, he <em>had</em> scattered thoughts on the night’s remainder. But <em>maybe</em> upon reflection, he was now collected about the night’s end. That’s <em>my</em> theory; my speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s possible, no — it’s <em>certain</em> that I embelished his recital. He used less words than I, although much more emphatically. He did — <em>however</em> — aside the following as something of his conclusion, so I’ll recite (almost) unimproved, “&nbsp;… possibly not interested in the tall dude … no … it was quite overt. Can’t rationalise my way out of her change of attention when I didn't reciprocate”. See? Not as eloquent as <em>my</em> prose. Still – can’t fault him on effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, I hadn’t seen him like this … methodically, rationally “psychosocioanalytical” … in a very long time. But it’s great to see it again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Welcome back buddy.
