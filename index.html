  <p>For some people, being one thing is everything.</p>
  <p>For others, being everything wouldn't be enough.</p>
  <p>And then you're warned before closing that the page hasn't been saved and chances may have been made. <em>May</em> have been made?</p>
  <h2>Incite</h2>
  <p>Should I keep trying.</p>

<p>Chances are that guy was her DJ fling, and that when I fell through, she followed up with him.</p>

<p>So *that* I'd have to deal with; even if she was still interested :P</p>

<p>But that'd make me the Mel; but is that such a bad thing?</p>

<p>I think it's worth a shot. Cos I'm actually serious. And my intentions are for real :P</p>

<p>BUT I've got to stay fun! Lighthearted</p>
<hr />

<p>This friend of mine, yesterday, had this sort of date that he was really kinda looking forward to. Stupidly, somehow, he misread their plan to meet at 9 as "9";. He'd only woken up at 6pm the night before, so after being out with his friend Laura when he got home at 5 he figured he'd stay up and spend the time getting ready :)</p>

<p>At some point, around 8:15 or so, it started to dawn on him how how strange it would be for someone to finish work at 9am. Feeling somewhat like a monkey dancing simpleton, he re-read the sms with his newly found brain, and he now had 12 hours till the new "9".</p>

<p>Then, at about 9:15, his housemate, also his brother, informed him that he'd just given his 28 days notice to leave their share house. My friend spent the next 4 hours researching rent and bond law and tenancy transfers, and basically realised he was boned and was going to have to leave when his brother did, as they were under one tenancy agreement. </p>
<p>He spent the next 3 hours trying not to freak :P trying to work out how he could keep the place - and as he had to start re-getting ready to go out realised he'd already missed a late lunch with a friend he'd arranged, and a job search appointment he was meant to go to. </p>
<p>It was about this time, about 9 or so, that it really started to hit him that he'd been up about 30 hours :P but he really wanted to meet this girl out, it was why he hadn't slept the night before anyway, so he HAD to balls up! </p>

<p>When he turned up at the place his friend had invited him to, he came to realise that his friend had failed to inform him that what he was 'crashing' was a birthday party of someone my initial friend didn't know, and not only that, but that the other friend was trying to set him up with one of his co-workers... Somehow he managed to avoid social suicide at that venue, even if the cocktails were $17 each :) they did *look* amazing.</p>
<p>The whole time at the expensive venue wishing he was hanging out with the people he'd originally thought he was going to be at 9am :P torn that although uninvited he was obliged to now stay until his friend left. Damn obligation. At least the chairs were awesome. And they had pots for $8. And the conversation was actually keeping him awake quite well.</p>

<p>At 11:30 they left, and enroute he spent his last $2 on two coffees from 7 eleven, for him and his friend who he was hoping would reciprocate and shout a beer at the next venue :P</p>
<p>They rest, as the say, well... u were there :P</p>

<p>It's possibly I over analysed this situation. That although not interested in the tall dude that ... no... it was quite overt. I can't rationalise my way out of her change of attention to him when I didn't reciprocate.</p>

<p>I haven't been this... psychologically analytical and worried and intense regarding in a long time. I don't <em>recal</em> it with Mel. I remember it with Suzy. It's most noticeable feature is that I am driven to write down my thoughts. To prevent their cyclical nature.</p>

<p>With Mel it was more somewhat pathetically poetic.</p>
