      <h2>Ga Ga</h2>
      <p>&#8220;Should I keep trying?&#8221; he said. To himself.
      Because by now my attention was elsewhere. I mouthed along
      with him his next sentence, having already heard it three
      times this morning. This would be the fourth.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Chances are that guy was her DJ fling, and that
      when I fell through, she followed up with him&#8221;.</p>
      <p>He realised he&#8216;d lost me, probably when he noticed
      I'd typed into my phone &#8216;DJ Fling&#8217; under a
      heading &#8216;Possible Future Stage Names&#8217;</p>
      <p>&#8220;So 
      <em>that</em> I&#8217;ll have to deal with; if she&#8217;s
      still interested.&#8221;</p>
      <p>That got my attention. Not only was that a decision, a
      break from the morning&#8217;s spiral, but it was almost as
      if he was serious. I realised I'd stopped walking
      midstep.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Would that really 
      <em>be</em> such a bad thing?&#8221;, I thought.</p>
      <p>No. I think
      it&#8217;s worth it. Not in the least 'cos he actually seems
      serious (and about time!), but also because his motives 
	  seem honest. So I&#8217;ve got to say &#8216;yay!&#8217;;
	  for him!</p>

      <h2>Hindsight</h2>
      <p>This friend of mine, yesterday, had had this "sort of date
      thing" that he had been "really kinda looking forward to". It
      turned out that originally, somehow, (although strangely not
      out of character) he had misread their plan to &#8220;meet at
      9&#8221; as &#8220;meet at 9 am&#8221;.</p>
      <p>Painfully for him (and his circadian rhythm) he'd woken up
      at 6pm the evening before after a solid day's sleep. So when
      a night out with friends landed him home at 5am the day of
      the rendezvous he figured he'd stay up and spend the time
      getting ready, rather than attempt to sleep. Logical
      right?</p>
      <p>At some point, around 8:15 or so, it dawned on him how how
      strange it would be for someone to finish work at 9am.
      Feeling somewhat like a monkey dancing simpleton, he re-read
      the sms with his newly found brain, and he now had 12 hours
      till the new "9".</p>
	  <hr />
	  <h2>Co-Tenency</h2>
      <p>Soon after, at about 9:15, his housemate
      informed him that he'd just given his 28 days notice to leave
      their share house. My friend spent the next 4 hours
      researching rent and bond law and tenancy transfers, and
      basically realised he was boned and was going to have to
      leave when his brother did, as they were under one tenancy
      agreement.</p>
      <p>He spent the next 3 hours trying not to freak :P trying to
      work out how he could keep the place - and as he had to start
      re-getting ready to go out realised he'd already missed a
      late lunch with a friend he'd arranged, and a job search
      appointment he was meant to go to.</p>
      <p>It was about this time, about 9 or so, that it really
      started to hit him that he'd been up about 30 hours :P but he
      really wanted to meet this girl out, it was why he hadn't
      slept the night before anyway, so he HAD to balls up!</p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Enthroned</h2>
      <p>When he turned up at the place his friend had invited him
      to, he came to realise that his friend had failed to inform
      him that what he was 'crashing' was a birthday party of
      someone my initial friend didn't know, and not only that, but
      that the other friend was trying to set him up with one of
      his co-workers &#8230; Somehow he managed to avoid social
      suicide at that venue, even if the cocktails were $17 each :)
      they did *look* amazing.</p>
      <p>The whole time at the expensive venue wishing he was
      hanging out with the people he'd originally thought he was
      going to be at 9am :P torn that although uninvited he was
      obliged to now stay until his friend left. Damn obligation.
      At least the chairs were awesome. And they had pots for $8.
      And the conversation was actually keeping him awake quite
      well.</p>
      <p>At 11:30 they left, and enroute he spent his last $2 on
      two coffees from 7 eleven, for him and his friend who he was
      hoping would reciprocate and shout a beer at the next venue
      :P</p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Enough</h2>
      <p>They rest, as the say, well &#8230; you had to be
      there.</p>
      <p>It's possibly I over analysed this situation. That
      although not interested in the tall dude that &#8230; no
      &#8230; it was quite overt. I can't rationalise my way out of
      her change of attention to him when I didn't reciprocate.</p>
      <p>I haven't been this &#8230; psychologically analytical and
      worried and intense regarding in a long time. I don't 
      <em>recal</em>it with Mel. I remember it with Suzy. It's most
      noticeable feature is that I am driven to write down my
      thoughts. To prevent their cyclical nature.</p>
      <p>With Mel it was more somewhat pathetically poetic.</p>
