      <h2>Ga Ga</h2>
      <p>&#8220;Should I keep trying?&#8221; he said. To himself.
      Because by now my attention was elsewhere. I mouthed along
      with him his next sentence, having already heard it three
      times this morning. This would be the fourth.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Chances are that guy was her DJ fling, and that
      when I fell through, she followed up with him&#8221;.</p>
      <p>He realised he&#8216;d lost me, probably when he noticed
      I&#8216;d typed into my phone &#8216;DJ Fling&#8217; under a
      heading &#8216;Possible Future Stage Names&#8217;</p>
      <p>&#8220;So 
      <em>that</em> I&#8217;ll have to deal with; if she&#8217;s
      still interested.&#8221;</p>
      <p>That got my attention. Not only was that a decision, a
      break from the morning&#8217;s spiral, but it was almost as
      if he was serious. I'd stopped walking
      midstep.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Would that really 
      <em>be</em> such a bad thing?&#8221;, I thought.</p>
      <p>No. No, it&#8216;s not. I think
      it&#8216;s a <em>good</em> thing. Not in the least cos he 
	  actually seems serious, but also because his motives 
	  seem honest. So I have got to say: &#8216;yay!&#8217; 
	  for him.</p>

      <h2>Hindsight</h2>
      <p>This friend of mine, yesterday, had had this &#8220;sort of date
      thing&#8221 that he had been &#8220;really kinda looking forward to&#8221;. 
	  He had gone on to inform me that somehow (although strangely not <em>that</em>
      out of character for him) he had misread their plan to &#8220;meet at
      9&#8221; as &#8220;meet at 9 <strong>am</strong>&#8221;.</p>
      <p>Painfully for him (and his circadian rhythm) he&rsquo;d woken up
      at 6 <strong>pm</strong> the evening prior having had a solid day&rsquo;s sleep. So when
      a night out with friends landed him home at 5am the day of
      the rendezvous, he figured he&rsquo;d stay up and spend the time
      getting ready (rather than &ndash; say &ndash; attempt to sleep). Logical
      right?</p>
      <p>He went on to explain that at some point, around 8:15am or so
	  he thinks, it dawned on him how
      strange it would actually be for someone to finish work at 9am.
      Feeling somewhat the simpleton, he re-read
      the sms (with his newly found brain) and he now had 12 hours
      till the new &#8220;9&#8221;.</p>
	  <hr />
	  <h2>Co-Tenency</h2>
      <p>Not long after the &#8220;off by 12 hours&#8221; discovery
	  (~9:15 by now) his housemate
      informed him that he&rsquo;d just given his 28 days notice to leave
      their share house. My friend then spent the next 4 hours
      researching rent and bond law and tenancy transfers, and
      basically realised he was boned and was going to have to
      leave when his brother did, as they were under one tenancy
      agreement.</p>
      <p>He spent the remaining few daylight hours not freaking out, 
	  rather trying to
      work out how he could keep the place. Researching leases,
	  bonds, bond loans, private loans, gumtree, types of leases,
	  co-tenancies, subleasing, tenancy acts, and multitudes of
	  words that had always &ldquo;just worked&rdquo; until now.</p>
	  <p>Eventually, and all too soon, he had to start
	  getting reading (again) for his 9 o&rsquo;clock. As he only now
	  checked his phone, it struck him he&rsquo;d missed a
      late lunch with a friend, and a job search
      appointment he needed to attend.</p>
      <p>It was about this time, about 9 or so, that it really
      started to hit him that he&rsquo;d been up about 30 hours.
	  The sleep deprivation and overwhelming madness of the
	  last 24 hours was urging my friend to pike &ndash; to call
	  the night off. But he really wanted to meet this girl again,
	  it was why he hadn't slept the night before anyway, so he
	  <strong>was</strong> going to turn up.</p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Enthroned</h2>
	  <p>In anticipation of, and in parallel to, the evening, 
	  my friend arranged a last minute wingman of sorts in
	  a mutual friend of mine and his. Our mutual friend informed
	  him that he was initially to be out with a theatrical
	  consort of his &ndash; and that as it was a at a public
	  venue, my friend was welcome to accompany.</p>
      <p>When he turned up at the place his friend had invited him
      to, he came to realise that his friend had failed to mention
	  that he was unofficially &ldquo;crashing&rdquo; a birthday party of
      someone he didn't know, and not only that, but the other 
	  friend seemed to be trying to set him up with one of
      his co-workers &#8230;</p>
	  Somehow (amidst the $17 cocktails, suits and high
	  backed chairs) he did however manage to avoid birthday party suicide 
	  in spite of (or due to?) his eccentric conversations about
	  wanting to own a thrown of his own design, as well as his
	  musings on the social expectations of sexuality and how this
	  relates to the notion	of gender, polyamory and pansexuality.
	  There was also a relatively mature conversation about mental
	  health; which my friend found very refreshing.</p>
      <p>Whilst at &lsquo;Expensive Venue&rsquo; (wishing he was
      hanging out with the people he'd originally thought he was
      going to be at 9am) torn that although uninvited he was
      obliged to now stay until his friend left. Damn obligation.
      At least the chairs were awesome. And they had pots for $8.
      And the conversation was actually keeping him awake quite
      well.</p>
      <p>At 11:30 they left, and enroute he spent his last $2 on
      two coffees from 7 eleven, for him and his friend who he was
      hoping would reciprocate and shout a beer at the next venue
      :P</p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Enough</h2>
      <p>They rest, as the say, well &#8230; you had to be
      there.</p>
      <p>It's possibly I over analysed this situation. That
      although not interested in the tall dude that &#8230; no
      &#8230; it was quite overt. I can't rationalise my way out of
      her change of attention to him when I didn't reciprocate.</p>
      <p>I haven't been this &#8230; psychologically analytical and
      worried and intense regarding in a long time. I don't 
      <em>recal</em>it with Mel. I remember it with Suzy. It's most
      noticeable feature is that I am driven to write down my
      thoughts. To prevent their cyclical nature.</p>
      <p>With Mel it was more somewhat pathetically poetic.</p>
