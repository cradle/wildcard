      <h2>gaga</h2>
      <p>&#8220;Should I keep trying?&#8221; he said. To himself.
      Because by now <em>my</em> attention was elsewhere. I mouthed along
      with him his next sentence, having already heard it three
      times this morning. This would be the fourth.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Chances are that guy was her DJ fling, and that
      when I fell through, she followed up with him&#8221;.</p>
      <p>He realised he&#8216;d lost me, probably when he noticed
      I&#8216;d typed into my phone &#8216;DJ Fling&#8217; under a
      heading &#8216;Possible Future Stage Names&#8217;</p>
      <p>&#8220;So 
      <em>that</em> I&#8217;ll have to deal with; if she&#8217;s
      still interested.&#8221;</p>
      <p>That got my attention. Not only was that a decision, a
      break from the morning&#8217;s spiral, but it was almost as
      if he was serious. I'd stopped walking
      midstep.</p>
      <p>&#8220;Would that really 
      <em>be</em> such a bad thing?&#8221;, I thought.</p>
      <p>No. No, it&#8216;s not. I think
      it&#8216;s a <em>good</em> thing. Not in the least cos he 
	  actually seems serious, but also because his motives 
	  seem honest. So I have got to say: &#8216;yay!&#8217; 
	  for him.</p>
      <h2>hindsight</h2>
      <p>This friend of mine, yesterday, had had this &#8220;sort of date
      thing&#8221 that he had been &#8220;really kinda looking forward to&#8221;. 
	  He had gone on to inform me that somehow (although strangely not <em>that</em>
      out of character for him) he had misread their plan to &#8220;meet at
      9&#8221; as &#8220;meet at 9 <strong>am</strong>&#8221;.</p>
      <p>Painfully for him (and his circadian rhythm) he&rsquo;d woken up
      at 6 <strong>pm</strong> the evening prior having had a solid day&rsquo;s sleep. So when
      a night out with friends landed him home at 5am the day of
      the rendezvous, he figured he&rsquo;d stay up and spend the time
      getting ready (rather than &ndash; say &ndash; attempt to sleep). Logical
      right?</p>
      <p>He went on to explain that at some point, around 8:15am or so
	  he thinks, it dawned on him how
      strange it would actually be for someone to finish work at 9am.
      Feeling somewhat the simpleton, he re-read
      the sms (with his newly found brain) and he now had 12 hours
      till the new &#8220;9&#8221;.</p>
	  <h2>co-tenant</h2>
      <p>Not long after the &#8220;off by 12 hours&#8221; discovery
	  (~9:15 by now) his housemate
      informed him that he&rsquo;d just given his 28 days notice to leave
      their share house. My friend then spent the next 4 hours
      googling the logistics of tenancy transfers &#8230;
      finally conceding he was commited to leave when his brother did
      (as a bond bound co-tenancy agreement infers).</p>
      <p>He spent the remaining few daylight hours not freaking out, 
	  rather trying to
      work out how he could keep the place; digging into
      leases, bonds, bond loans, private loans, gumtree, types of leases,
	  co-tenancies, subleasing, tenancy acts &mdash; a multitude of
	  words that until now, had &ldquo;just worked&rdquo;.</p>
	  <p>Eventually, and all too soon, he had to start
	  getting reading (again) for his 9 o&rsquo;clock.
	  Checking his phone for the first time since the news, 
      it struck him he&rsquo;d missed a
      late lunch with a friend, and a job search
      appointment he needed to attend. He blazed apologetic SMSes 
      off his phone.</p>
      <p>It was about this time, 9 or so, that it really
      hit that he&rsquo;d been awake over 30 hours.
	  The sleep deprivation and madness of the
	  last 24 hours urged my friend to pike &ndash; to call
	  the night off. But he really wanted to meet his &ldquo;sort
      of date&rdquo; again,
	  it was after all why he hadn't slept the night before anyway,
      so he <strong>was</strong> going to turn up.</p>
      <h2>enthroned</h2>
	  <p>In parallel with the evening, he arranged a last 
      minute wingman of sorts in a mutual friend of ours.
      Our mutual friend informed
	  him that he&rsquo;d be out with a theatrical
	  consort of his &mdash; yet at a public
	  venue; so my friend was <em>obviously</em> welcome.</p>
      <p>Upon arrival, he soon realised that his friend
      had failed to mention that he was unofficially 
      &ldquo;crashing&rdquo; a birthday party of
      someone he didn't know. And not only that, his
	  friend <em>seemed</em> to be trying to set 
      him up with one of his co-workers &#8230;</p>
	  Somehow (amidst the $17 cocktails, suits and high
	  backed chairs) he managed to avoid birthday party suicide; 
	  in spite of (or due to?) his eclectic conversations about
	  wanting to own a thrown of his own design; and musings on 
      social expectations affecting sexuality: how it marginalises
	  the ideals of transgender, polyamory and pansexuality.
	  There also happened a mature conversation about mental
	  health; which he found quite refreshing.</p>
      <h2>silver lining</h2>
      <p>Yet whilst at Expensive Venue&#153;, he couldn&rsquo;t
      shake the feeling he&rsquo;d rather be elsewhere.
      With the people he&rsquo;d thought he would be by 9am.
      Now, &frac12; an earth day hence, he was torn. Yes he started
      uninvited, but now he was obliged to stay until his 
      friend left. Bright side: he self insisted. The chairs were
      awesome. They had $8 pots. And the conversation was 
      actually keeping him quite engaged.</p>
      <p>At 11:30 they left, and enroute he spent his last $2 on
      two coffees from 7 eleven, for him and his friend who he was
      hoping would reciprocate and shout a beer at the next venue
      :P</p>
      <h2>be all</h2>
      <p>Sleep deprived, caffienated, &lsquo;28 days noticed&rsquo;,
      and now penniless. At least he had his health, they usually say
      as consolation.<p>
      <p>They also say &ndash; sometimes &ndash; that you had to be
      there. And possibly, you did have to be. And possibly, 
      you were. Who knows? His tone, however, suggested story
      from here was best left expertiential.</p>
      <p>Inherintly subjective, or some such, perhaps. Although to be 
      truthful, he failed to mention the night&rsquo;s remainder
      whatsoever. Maybe he realised, after divulging the events prior,
      that he was now rather collected about the nights conclusion.</p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s possible, no &mdash; it&rsquo;s <em>certain</em>
      that I embelished his recital. He used less words than I, although
      much more emphatically. He did &mdash; <em>however</em>
      &mdash; aside this as somewhat of an exit statement, so
      I&rsquo;ll recite (mostly) untouched, &ldquo;&nbsp;&#8230; possibly not
      interested in the tall dude &#8230; no &#8230; it was quite overt. 
      Can&rsquo;t rationalise my way out of her change of attention when I didn't reciprocate&rdquo;. 
      See? Not as eloquent as <em>my</em> prose. 
      Still &ndash; can&rsquo;t fault him on effort.</p>
      <p>I hadn&rsquo;t seen him this &#8230; &ldquo;psychosocioanalytical&rdquo;
      in an age. But it&rsquo;s good to see it again.</p>
      <p>Welcome back, old friend.</p>
